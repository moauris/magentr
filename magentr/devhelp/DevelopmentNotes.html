            <h2>Development Introduction<a name="intro" /></h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to make a C# written tool
                exclusively for the Control-M Agent Requests and
                related innformation management.
            </p>

            <p>
                user can rely on this tool to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Validate, Accept, Process Control-M Agent from Appli Side users.</li>
                    <li>Manage, Export, View request ticket data, M/Agent information, System Information, and server information.</li>
                    <li>Some other functions waiting to update.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Scope and Progress</h2>
            <p>
                The mile stone for completing the project and release as production should be when the tool can complete one cycle of most basic task: <br />
                To Accept an M/Agent Request, process it, sync information to Database (probably Access Database).
            </p>
            <p>Later functions can be added into the early releases gradually.</p>
            <h2>Version 0.0.0.1</h2>
            <a name="v0001" />
            <p>
                To test the new Form load speed on Shapes, make a test run: All Shapes top left corner cell mark as interior color green.
                Success!

                as shown on the right, all shape's top left cell are colorized as Red:
                <img class="demo_horizaontal_strip" src="resources/colorshapestopleftred.jpg"/>
            </p>
            <p>This means that it can fetch the data within a certain cell using LINQ.</p>
            <h3>Making of Shape Fetching method for Each Group</h3>
            <p>
                Input Object: Cell Range for a group of Check Box Items. <br />
                Output Object: <strike>A Range Object Value of the Check Box Checked.</strike><br />
                Output Object: A dictionary with range as key and value as string.

            </p>
            <p>
                Success! The process can now take a Range Value, and return a string value.
                Some learning points:<br />
                C# cannot refer to COMS Object to test against another COMS Object. Even if they refer to the same COMS
                C# still sees them as two different Objects, and won't trigger the if true statements.<br />
                If using the Used Range method, then the object cannot use a [cell1, cell2] structure to fetch the cell object in fixed value,
                it has to be used like an iteration. But, the Worksheet.Range[] can be used like this, so there is really no need to 
                specify the used Range Object again, I'm going to do a specification mapping anyways.
