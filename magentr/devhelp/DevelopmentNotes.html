            <h2>Development Introduction<a name="intro" /></h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to make a C# written tool
                exclusively for the Control-M Agent Requests and
                related innformation management.
            </p>

            <p>
                user can rely on this tool to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Validate, Accept, Process Control-M Agent from Appli Side users.</li>
                    <li>Manage, Export, View request ticket data, M/Agent information, System Information, and server information.</li>
                    <li>Some other functions waiting to update.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Scope and Progress</h2>
            <p>
                The mile stone for completing the project and release as production should be when the tool can complete one cycle of most basic task: <br />
                To Accept an M/Agent Request, process it, sync information to Database (probably Access Database).
            </p>
            <p>Later functions can be added into the early releases gradually.</p>
            <h2>Version 0.0.0.1</h2>
            <a name="v0001" />
            <p>
                To test the new Form load speed on Shapes, make a test run: All Shapes top left corner cell mark as interior color green.
                Success!

                as shown on the right, all shape's top left cell are colorized as Red:
                <img class="demo_horizaontal_strip" src="resources/colorshapestopleftred.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>This means that it can fetch the data within a certain cell using LINQ.</p>
            <h3>Making of Shape Fetching method for Each Group</h3>
            <p>
                Input Object: Cell Range for a group of Check Box Items. <br />
                Output Object: <strike>A Range Object Value of the Check Box Checked.</strike><br />
                Output Object: A dictionary with range as key and value as string.

            </p>
            <p>
                Success! The process can now take a Range Value, and return a string value.
                Some learning points:<br />
                C# cannot refer to COMS Object to test against another COMS Object. Even if they refer to the same COMS
                C# still sees them as two different Objects, and won't trigger the if true statements.<br />
                If using the Used Range method, then the object cannot use a [cell1, cell2] structure to fetch the cell object in fixed value,
                it has to be used like an iteration. But, the Worksheet.Range[] can be used like this, so there is really no need to
                specify the used Range Object again, I'm going to do a specification mapping anyways.

            </p>
            <h3>
                Creating RequestSheet, RequestColumns, MAgent, and server Classes.
            </h3>
            <p>
                In This step, 4 classes are created, just like the hierarchy order of the information being processed.
            </p>
            <h3>
                A Little Thoughts on Development (2019-02-26 09:50:03)
            </h3>
            <p>Evidently, there is a need to make the procedure run faster.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Using COMS object (unmanaged memory) is so slow, that it almost doesn't make sense. (35 seconds+)</strong>
                The Current idea is much like the first time I'm writing this code.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I need are two copies of informations from the sheet right away.
                <ul>
                    <li>Values in designated cells</li>
                    <li>Values in Checkboxes</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Different from the first time conundrum, I now know about a way to fetch "Address" (Such as "$H$37"), and link it to a value.
                Even Check Box Items can do that. Because I know how to use a dictionary Object.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure then becomes more simple, make a "load" method that takes an excel object, and "spew out" a Dictionary Object, which is to be
                used by all the entire procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the testing for the process run by using the <br />
                <code>Do { Get-Process -Name Excel ; Start-Sleep -Seconds 2 } While ($true)</code><br />
                In Powershell.
                And the result is:<br />
                <img class="demo_horizaontal_strip" src="resources/Excel_Process_Active.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                It runs for about 17 seconds, almost the same as the debug log says.<br />
                And more importantly, it automatically ends the process without any hold up.
            </p>

            <h3>Major Bug: Form Area Dictionary uses Check Box Ranges</h3>
            <p>
                ...which causes the program to abend with Key Already added.
                So the list needs to be splited, still. one formarea, one checkbox.
            </p>
            <h3>What about directly to a database</h3>
            <p>
                I'm now very confused about the structure of the code. It doesn't seem to be a neccessity to
                first get the information into C# Managed memories, and then all together into a database. If Database is always an option. <br />
                <strong>Why not just connect to a database in the first place.</strong><br />
                No more type conversions, no more object construction errors. No more disgusting hierarchical inherit stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, by sycning the Excel Document, the CRL generates two managable dictionary objects.
                Currently, there was an intermediate object hierarchy that trys to sync the worksheet content.
                But by using the database implementations,
                we can use the database as a way to get and set
                the all level objects without having to construct any of them in the first place.<br />
                All Levels of M/Agent objects still exists, but their constructor takes get and set methods, where:
                <ul>
                    <li>When set is called: Generates an SQL object that ready to sync into the database.</li>
                    <li>When get is called: Generates a string block for the information of that M/Agent Request object.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <h3>Database Plan Progress</h3>
            <p>
                Progress 1: Only synced non-null range. Target Range downed from 2544,
                to 414. Loading time is now 4 seconds for all cell Objects.
            </p>
            <p>I can not successfully sync into the database with the request by reusing the same insert command object.</p>
            <p>It's either that or, I need to close the connection, then open it again.</p>
            <p>
                But, for the most part, it looks like this: <br />
                Request Table before Update Automatically:
                <img class="demo_horizaontal_strip" src="resources/databasebeforesync.jpg" /><br />
                Then there is the same table after automatic update:
                <img class="demo_horizaontal_strip" src="resources/databaseaftersync.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                But the problem here is that it gets a little bit buggy with the reuse of the same variable.
                <br />
                <code>
                    System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException: 'Duplicate output destination 'MS_Connection'.'
                </code>
                <br />
            </p>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46434189/duplicate-output-destination-oledb">
                StackOverFlow: C# Duplicate-output-desitinationn-oledb
            </a>
            <p>Try Clear the parameters in the insert command and see it if helps.</p>
            <p>This is so disgusting, I can't imagine this whole project getting stopped only because the database refuse to sync.
            Let's try the using statement to reinitialize the connection object.
            Resolved: Looks like one connection object must be disposed before you can re-use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                DateTime Object returns with Type Mismatch error: Be careful with DateTime.Now, because if the database only takes
                YYYY-MM-DD format, DateTime.Now represents a time type varaible in Database.
                If we use DateTime.Today, it will return a date variable, and can be accepted.
            </p>
            <h3>How to resolve the Error "INSERT INTO Syntax Error"</h3>
            <p>
                Basically this time it was caused by the table column "bit", looks like it was reserved or something.
                How to resolve this type of error "SQL Syntax Error" Is to make a OLEDbCommand.ToString(), and then try to 
                use it in the Access Database. If there are any Syntax errors there will be reminders at least on "which".
            </p>
            <p>
                Next on the development list is to create a procedure that checks if the file had been synced already.
                This check should be done even before the entire worksheet gets called, since calling the worksheet and loading
                it seems to take up much of the process time of the run.
            </p>
            <h3>Some Other Minor Functionalities</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>[Done]</strong> Query the database tbRequests to find if files with the same request has already existed. If so, exist returning
                message "file found already exist in Database, request ID: xx." 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>[Done]</strong> Next is to get all debug information into a formated text in the debug output page.
            </p>
            <p>
                There needs to be some sort of mechanism to sync and make sure each tbServer row gets a unique entry. This part is easy to do,
                what is difficult is what to do with it next.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Current Running M/Agent Database.
                Now, this is interesting because I already have a tbAgent table that has all the Agent information Available.
                In ECS running environment, however, there is a list of another kind of M/Agent information, that is currently available M/Agents.
                <br />
                Like I have imagined to make, there must be an M/Agent Desired State Table, but here I think it can be made into the 
                tbECSMAgent.
                <br />
                However, with tbECSMAgent, there needs to be a log sort of thing to keep track of M/Agent Changes.
            </p>
            <h3>Reverse Sync Order &amp; Unite ProgressBar</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, the sync to database is a cascade down type of method, Request => Columns => Servers.
                However, I think it would be better to do it the other way, which is: <strong>Servers => Columns => Request</strong>

            </p>
            <p>
                The progress bar had better be one single run for one single request.<br />
                Currently there are about 3 or 4 instances where it is broken and reset.
                Line 157: Set to 100, for Opening WorkBook File.
                Line 196: Set to Total Filled Range, for finding all Range Objects to CRL Dictionary(144&plusmn;30 Objects)
                Line 210: Set to Total Checked Boxes, about 10

            </p>
            <h3>The Efficiency Business</h3>
            <p>
                Currently the process runs for 30 second per cycle, which is where I left it basically.

                Summary: Tolist actually takes all the time trying to make
                Excel Objects out of the CRL, inside the Excel.Application Object
                into the CRL, and therefore making it more friendly to query.
                The tradeoff is that the ToList itself takes a long time to initialize.
                After that, it is going to be rather quick. <br />
                On the other hand, The IEnumerable used directly almost takes no time to
                initialize, but as a trade off, every time the IEnumerable is called (foreach, count, etc.)
                it iterate through the entire unmanaged memory to fetch the few data, and it can be 
                exponentially time consuming.<br />
                I guess as far as efficiency is concerned, for my application in particular, it nearly makes no difference.
                The original question the questioner was trying to query 2000+ lines of records and it takes minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gives me the ability to make an all query.

                After the code is optimized to be a progress bar indetermined, the efficiency had improved to be 11 seconds.

            <h3>New Feature: Process multiple files / process a folder</h3>
            <p>
                One of the problems with multiple file process is that it takes too much time to open / close the workbook.
                It takes about 7 - 8 seconds to load and close the excel, eh, maybe it's fine.
            </p>
            <h3>Some modifications to the tbAgent Table</h3>
            <p>
                There needs to be somekind of M/Agent Identifyer in the tbAgent Table.
                <br />
                If M/Agent's M/Server cannot be found, refuse to sync M/Agent
                <br />
                Add a new column called "AgentName", it contains a piece of information like this: $Datacenter.$Agent<br />
                uny40510.aur00101 => for example.
            </p>
            <h3>Efficiency is now acceptable, proceeding to Sync Order</h3>
            <p>
                The issue now is with the sync order. Currently we are syncing the request by the order of Request File =>
                Columns => Agents. The "using" statement didn't quite help with it, as syncing each table is now independant.
                Going down this path would mean if a sync error had happened, I need to reverse (delete) previously synced 
                lines from another table.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm imagining a structure similar to this: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One method that takes a filename as an argument, and checks and sync all tables.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Validationg: File Exist ? Proceed : Abort.</li>
                            <li>Database: Filename not exist in Database ? Proceed : Abort.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
